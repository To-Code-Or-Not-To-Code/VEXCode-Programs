# README GUIDE

All readmes should start with `# <insert_program_name_here>`. Under that line, write a brief description of what the program does and how to use it.

For example, let's say we have a program that makes the lights flash on the robot. The `README.md` would look something like this:
```markdown
# Disco-Bot
Flashes the LEDs on the bot.
```

Another thing you should add is which components are on which ports, what generation of brain is being used, etc.

Under there, add either `> :white_check_mark: This project is completed! `, `> :warning: This code isn't complete, do **NOT** use this yet. Feel free to complete the code!`, or `> :exclamation: This code has been depreciated. Please do **NOT** use this code. However, feel free to update this!`

You're done!

> [!TIP]
> You can use the backtick (\`) character to make text look like `this`. You can use asterisks to make *italic* text and use two asterisks on each side to make **bolded** text.

Final code:
```markdown
# Disco-Bot
Flashes the LEDs on the bot.

Written in C++. Either use the `Load from your computer using` option with the `iqcpp` file or copy-paste from the `cpp` file.

Made for the 1st generations of brains. The code expects 3 lights attached to ports 5, 9, and 12.

## Feel free to modify this style guide!

P.S.: You may use other features in Markdown such as tables, alerts, subheadings, etc.
