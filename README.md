# VEXCode-Programs
Basically what the name says.

## Directory Structure
Please structure your directory like this:

```
program_name/
    - README.md
    - program_name.cpp (if using c++, otherwise, don't include it)
    - program_name.iqcpp (if using c++, otherwise, use program_name.iqblocks)
```

The file `README.md` should have information about the program and use directions (if necessary). It should also have a badge showing if it is in progress completed. Please read the full README guide if you need to.
